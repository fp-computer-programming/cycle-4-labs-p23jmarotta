#Get user's first name
first_name =  input('What is you first name?')

# Get user's last name
last_name = input('And what is your last name?')

# Full name variable
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name

# If you just add the two varibables together, there is no space between names
# We fixed this by adding + ' ' in between the two names
